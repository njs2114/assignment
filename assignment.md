<p>Write a program that stores, and displays a list of people's names and birthdays.</p>

<p>Commands that should be supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>add (name, date): add a person and their birthday to the list</li>
<li>remove (name): remove a person and their birthday from the list</li>
<li>(name): display birthday information for the named person</li>
<li>no arguments: display the entire list of names and bithdays</li>
</ul>

<p>If add is used to add a person with the same name as someone already in the list, the user should be prompted to decide if the old entry should be replaced or the new entry should be discarded.</p>
